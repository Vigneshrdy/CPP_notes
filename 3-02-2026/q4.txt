Update Array Elements Based on Criteria
Problem Statement
You are developing an inventory management system for a warehouse. The system tracks product stock levels in an array. Due to a quality control issue, you need to update stock quantities based on specific criteria.
Given an integer array inventory where each element represents the stock quantity of a product, and given a threshold value and an adjustment value, update all products that meet certain criteria.
Update Rule: For all products where the stock quantity is greater than or equal to the threshold, apply the adjustment (which can be positive or negative).
Return the updated inventory array.

Examples
Example 1:
Input: inventory = [50, 30, 80, 20, 100], threshold = 40, adjustment = -10
Output: [40, 30, 70, 20, 90]

Explanation: 
- 50 >= 40, so 50 - 10 = 40
- 30 < 40, no change = 30
- 80 >= 40, so 80 - 10 = 70
- 20 < 40, no change = 20
- 100 >= 40, so 100 - 10 = 90
Example 2:
Input: inventory = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], threshold = 25, adjustment = 5
Output: [10, 20, 35, 45, 55]

Explanation: 
Elements 30, 40, 50 are >= 25, so they get +5 adjustment.
Example 3:
Input: inventory = [100, 200, 150], threshold = 500, adjustment = -50
Output: [100, 200, 150]

Explanation: 
No elements meet the threshold criteria, so no updates occur.
Example 4:
Input: inventory = [5, 5, 5, 5], threshold = 5, adjustment = 10
Output: [15, 15, 15, 15]

Explanation: 
All elements equal the threshold (5 >= 5), so all get updated.

Constraints

1 <= inventory.length <= 10^4
-10^9 <= inventory[i] <= 10^9
-10^9 <= threshold <= 10^9
-10^9 <= adjustment <= 10^9


Problem Variations
Variation 1: Update with Range
Update elements that fall within a range [minThreshold, maxThreshold].
javaInput: inventory = [10, 25, 50, 75, 100], minThreshold = 20, maxThreshold = 60, adjustment = -5
Output: [10, 20, 45, 70, 100]

Explanation: Only 25, 50, and 75 are in range [20, 60], so they get adjusted.
Variation 2: Update with Multiple Criteria
Update elements based on multiple conditions (e.g., even numbers above threshold).
javaInput: inventory = [10, 15, 20, 25, 30], threshold = 15, adjustment = 2
Criteria: Update only EVEN numbers >= threshold
Output: [10, 15, 22, 25, 32]

Explanation: 20 and 30 are even and >= 15, so updated to 22 and 32.
Variation 3: Conditional Update with Index
Update elements based on both value and position (e.g., update odd indices if value > threshold).
javaInput: inventory = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], threshold = 15, adjustment = 5
Criteria: Update only elements at ODD indices AND value > threshold
Output: [10, 25, 30, 45, 50]

Explanation: 
- Index 1: value=20 > 15, odd index → 20+5 = 25
- Index 3: value=40 > 15, odd index → 40+5 = 45
Variation 4: Percentage-based Update
Update elements by a percentage rather than fixed adjustment.
javaInput: inventory = [100, 50, 200, 75], threshold = 60, percentageIncrease = 20
Output: [120, 50, 240, 90]

Explanation: 
- 100 >= 60, so 100 + (100 * 0.20) = 120
- 50 < 60, no change
- 200 >= 60, so 200 + (200 * 0.20) = 240
- 75 >= 60, so 75 + (75 * 0.20) = 90

Follow-up Questions

What is the time complexity of your solution?
Can you solve this in-place without using extra space?
How would you handle the case where adjustment causes negative inventory?
What if you need to track which elements were updated (return their indices)?
How would you optimize if most elements don't meet the criteria?
What if the array is sorted? Can you optimize the solution?
