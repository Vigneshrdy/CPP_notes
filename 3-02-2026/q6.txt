Problem:
Reverse every group of k elements in an array. If remaining elements are less than k, reverse all of them.
Examples:
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], k = 3
Output: [3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 4, 8, 7]
Explanation: First 3 reversed, next 3 reversed, last 2 reversed

Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 2
Output: [2, 1, 4, 3, 5]
What will happen for 
k = 1
k >= array length 
k = 0
